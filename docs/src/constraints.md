# Constraints

An interesting observation: adding a single element propagates to the next level.

```
julia> g1 = "."^64
"................................................................"
julia> m1 = init_multi(g1);
julia> reshape(m1, (4, 4, 4))
4×4×4 Array{String, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 "1234"  "1234"  "1234"  "1234"
 "1234"  "1234"  "1234"  "1234"
 "1234"  "1234"  "1234"  "1234"
 "1234"  "1234"  "1234"  "1234"

[:, :, 2] =
 "1234"  "1234"  "1234"  "1234"
 "1234"  "1234"  "1234"  "1234"
 "1234"  "1234"  "1234"  "1234"
 "1234"  "1234"  "1234"  "1234"

[:, :, 3] =
 "1234"  "1234"  "1234"  "1234"
 "1234"  "1234"  "1234"  "1234"
 "1234"  "1234"  "1234"  "1234"
 "1234"  "1234"  "1234"  "1234"

[:, :, 4] =
 "1234"  "1234"  "1234"  "1234"
 "1234"  "1234"  "1234"  "1234"
 "1234"  "1234"  "1234"  "1234"
 "1234"  "1234"  "1234"  "1234"
```

This is an empty board (all values allowed at all positions).

Now add a single "1" in the top left corner:

```
julia> assign!(m1, 1, '1')
true

julia> reshape(m1, (4, 4, 4))
4×4×4 Array{String, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 "1"    "234"   "234"   "234"
 "234"  "234"   "1234"  "1234"
 "234"  "1234"  "1234"  "1234"
 "234"  "1234"  "1234"  "1234"

[:, :, 2] =
 "234"   "234"  "1234"  "1234"
 "234"   "1"    "234"   "234"
 "1234"  "234"  "1234"  "1234"
 "1234"  "234"  "1234"  "1234"

[:, :, 3] =
 "234"   "1234"  "1234"  "1234"
 "1234"  "234"   "1234"  "1234"
 "1234"  "1234"  "1234"  "1234"
 "1234"  "1234"  "1234"  "1234"

[:, :, 4] =
 "234"   "1234"  "1234"  "1234"
 "1234"  "234"   "1234"  "1234"
 "1234"  "1234"  "1234"  "1234"
 "1234"  "1234"  "1234"  "1234"

```

The `assign!` function also calls eliminate and propagate to give the new allowed possibilities.

Note the "1" in [2,2,2].
